Quotes are from <i>The Complete Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe</i> (penguin edition). 

`quotes.txt` contains the Notes (unformatted) i made while i was reading it. The content of the file was generated by apple's official Books app - which allows me to share items I highlight on epubs through an email.

`quotes_formatted_1.txt` contains each note on every line. Minor changes have been made to this file after initial creation by the program to make it more suitable for a quote generator. A couple of incoherent notes that had been present in the original file have been deleted.
